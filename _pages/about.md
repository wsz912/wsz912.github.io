I am a lecturer (HENU-100 Talents Program) at Henan University.
Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, working closely with Assistant Professor   [Wei Gao](https://gaowei262.github.io/). I received my Ph.D. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Professor [Yao Lu](https://www.smbu.edu.cn/info/5721/77061.htm). My current research interests include light field image super-resolution, depth estimation and 3DGS.
